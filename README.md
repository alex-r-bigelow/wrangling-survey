# wrangling-survey

How do you think about your data? Is it a network? Is it spatial? Something else?

What if you could change your mind?

Add your perspective to the conversation by [taking the survey](https://alex-r-bigelow.github.io/wrangling-survey/?context=Github).

## Survey results and citing
You can explore the survey results through [an interactive webpage](https://alex-r-bigelow/github.io/wrangling-survey/Responses.html). Filters that you apply will change the URL to link to those specific settings.

If you wish to cite data from this survey in a publication, please contact the study coordinator via [email](mailto:alexrbigelow@email.arizona.edu) for now; the responses will be archived on osf.io in the coming weeks, and we are currently experimenting to find the best way(s) to hardlink to specific responses via the DOI.

## About the survey design

This survey employs two innovations for qualitative analysis that we hope will help to capture blind spots in how we have characterized the design space of possible data abstractions:

- An editable glossary, to encourage participants to help better map our jargon to the words and concepts that people actually think use in practice.

- "Protest" buttons that encourage the user to skip portions of the survey where they recognize that the questions that we are asking may not adequately capture their main concerns or perspectives.
