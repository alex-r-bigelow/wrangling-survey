# Contributions of the paper
## **C1** Dataset that characterizes the design space of abstraction transformations
Includes a simplified taxonomy and dataset that characterizes the design space of data abstractions

### Addresses core needs:
- WTB.C1
- WTB.C2
- TVR.C1

## **C3** System that has successfully been used as a communication tool for DSWs, WTBs and (potentially) VTDs, VDSRs
Includes theoretical communication (terminology map) and in practical communication (bulletin board)

### Addresses core needs:
- DSW.C1
- DSW.C2
- WTB.C3

### Potentially could help with other needs:
- DSW.N1
- DSW.N2
- VTD.N1
- VDSR.N1
- VDSR.N2

## **C4** System that has successfully been used as a creativity / education tool for DSWs and (potentially) VEs

### Addresses core needs:
- DSW.C3
- DSW.C4

### Potentially could help with other needs:
- VE.N1
- VE.N2
