# Dataset that characterizes the design space of abstractions and transformations
Includes a simplified taxonomy that characterizes the design space of data abstractions

## Addresses needs
- PN.WTB.1
- PN.WTB.2
- PN.TVR.1

## Evaluations, Models
- **E1** PN.WTB.1
  - Qualitatively evaluate the extent to which existing general-purpose systems support / do not support each DAS [Tableau, Gephi, LineUp, UpSet, Jigsaw, etc] / ETS [Trifacta, Ploceus, Orion, Origraph, Google Refine, etc] entry
  - Note: This feels like FTC, but the problem is that most users are *maybe* familiar with just one or two of the systems that we're evaluating... so we need to do the evaluation based on their descriptions, and FTC is best left as future work
- **E2** PN.WTB.2
  - Describe hypothetical tools (like the Bridge Model paper), based on individual ETS responses, that meet the WTB.2.1, WTB.2.2 criteria
- **M** PN.TVR.1
  - Model based on observed ETS responses
  - Goal is to model the shift in semantic *mental models*, from one data abstraction to another
  - Is our simplified taxonomy broad enough to avoid many N/A responses? If so, can a simple graph model the design space of transformations?
  - Is a simple graph sufficient, or is a (directed) hypergraph needed?
