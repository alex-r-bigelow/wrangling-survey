Persona-Specific Needs
======================
The survey we are designing, and the data that we are collecting, may be relevant for a diverse range of people. This is an enumeration of many possible needs; see longTermContributions.md for when we plan to address which needs.

# **PN.DSW** Data Science Workers
- **PN.DSW.1** Need for a tool to suggest or support search / discovery of similar data abstractions and associated:
  - **PN.DSW.1.1** wrangling tools
  - **PN.DSW.1.2** visualization software
- **PN.DSW.2** Need for a tool to suggest or support search / discovery of similar data transformations and associated software
- **PN.DSW.3** Need for a creativity exercise that provokes out-of-the-box analysis questions
  - Bigelow et al. "Reflections on How Designers Design with Data" AVI 2014
- **PN.DSW.4** Need for opportunities to learn unfamiliar CS concepts in the context of familiar data, using familiar terms to the extent that they are available
- **PN.DSW.5** Need for opportunities to connect with Wrangling Tool Builders, Visualization Technique Developers, or Visualization Design Study Researchers for more in-depth collaborations
- **PN.DSW.6** Need for opportunities for voice / perspective / language / specific problems to be heard in a way that (could) impact the design of future tools

# **PN.WTB** Wrangling Tool Builders
- **PN.WTB.1** Needs a set of real-world, crisply defined data abstractions that can be used to 1) design and/or 2) evaluate the extent to which a generalized tool is capable of modeling a diverse array of specific abstractions
  -
- **PN.WTB.2** To motivate / justify new wrangling tools, needs real-world, crisply described examples of data transformations that:
  - **PN.WTB.2.1** In their basic form, require less than the expressiveness of Turing-complete programming languages
    -
  - **PN.WTB.2.2** Do not yet have adequate support in existing software (especially w.r.t. interface designs that eliminate/reduce the need for programming)
    -
- **PN.WTB.3** Needs to know how to use terminology effectively for:
  - **PN.WTB.3.1** More easily-understood domain concepts (for domain-specific tools)
  - **PN.WTB.4.2** More easily-understood general terms for CS jargon (for general tools)

# **PN.TVR** Theoretical Visualization Researchers
- **PN.TVR.1** Need for a characterization of the design space for non-tabular data abstraction transformations
- **PN.TVR.2** Need to understand the extent to which our terminology is compatible with other domains
- **PN.TVR.3** Need to understand the extent to which discrepancies between mental models and raw data:
  - **PN.TVR.3.1** exist
  - **PN.TVR.3.2** are problematic

# **PN.VTD** Visualization Technique Developers
- **PN.VTD.1** Needs real-world, crisply described examples of specific data abstractions that do not yet have adequate visualization support; our work could improve *a little* on current Maslow's hammer practices

# **PN.VDSR** Visualization Design Study Researchers
- **PN.VDSR.1** Needs to jump-start collaborations with Data Science Workers:
  - **PN.VDSR.1.1** Do they have interesting data problems?
  - **PN.VDSR.1.2** How to be advised in advance of common winnowing problems?
  - **PN.VDSR.1.3** How to translate between domain concepts and CS jargon?
- **PN.VDSR.2** Needs evidence that a given data abstraction effectively represents a Data Science Worker's mental model

# **PN.VE** Visualization Educators
- **PN.VE.1** Needs ways to encourage students to explore more varied visualization designs
- **PN.VE.2** Needs ways to teach data abstraction concepts to students with non-CS backgrounds
