  <h3 class="analystFacing">Think of any dataset</h3>
  <p class="analystFacing">This can be a dataset that you currently work with; a dataset that you have worked with in the past; a dataset that you are simply familiar with; or even a hypothetical dataset that doesn't exist (yet).</p>

  <p>Please describe the real-world meaning of the dataset (as opposed to its structure). How is it (or could) it be useful? What questions could it help you answer?</p>

  <div class="field">
    <textarea data-key="domainDescription" id="domainDescription"  placeholder="Short responses such as the following are perfectly adequate:&#10;&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;A collection of brain MRI scans that are used to investigate changes in brain shape as people age&#34;&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Survey responses that may help characterize the design space of data wrangling tools&#34;"></textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If you choose a hypothetical dataset, or a dataset that you haven't yet worked with, some of the questions that we ask may require you to speculate. This is just fine; please feel free to submit creative responses!</p>

  <h3>Please choose a short label for this dataset</h3>
  <p>We will use this label in later parts of the survey, and in the public data that we release, to distinguish this dataset from any other responses that you submit.</p>
