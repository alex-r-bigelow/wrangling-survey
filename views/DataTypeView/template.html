<h3>How often do each of the following characterize how you would normally <strong>think</strong> about the dataset?</h3>

<!-- General-purpose abstractions; you can almost always model data as one of these -->
<div class="field">
  <p>The dataset is <span class="inspectable">tabular</span>; I think about it in terms of <span class="inspectable">row</span>s and <span class="inspectable">column</span>s.</p>
  <div class="likert" data-key="tabularThinking" id="tabularThinking" data-likert="Never,Rarely,Sometimes,Very Often,Always"></div>
</div>
<div class="field">
  <p>The dataset is a <span class="inspectable">network</span> or <span class="inspectable">hierarchy</span>; I think about it in terms of <span class="inspectable">node</span>s and <span class="inspectable">edge</span>s.</p>
  <div class="likert" data-key="networkThinking" id="networkThinking" data-likert="Never,Rarely,Sometimes,Very Often,Always"></div>
</div>
<div class="field">
  <p>The dataset is <span class="inspectable">spatial</span> or <span class="inspectable">temporal</span>; I think about it in terms of <span class="inspectable">point</span>s or <span class="inspectable">region</span>s in space or time.</p>
  <div class="likert" data-key="spatialThinking" id="spatialThinking" data-likert="Never,Rarely,Sometimes,Very Often,Always"></div>
</div>
<div class="field">
  <p>The dataset is <span class="inspectable">grouped</span>; I think about it in terms of <span class="inspectable">cluster</span>s or <span class="inspectable">set</span>s.</p>

<!-- Additional mental models that could be independent of general-purpose abstractions, but are less likely to be able to model all datasets -->
<div class="field">
  <p>The dataset is <span class="inspectable">textual</span>; I think about it in terms of <span class="inspectable">word</span>s or <span class="inspectable">document</span>s.</p>

</div>
<div class="field">
  <p>The dataset is <span class="inspectable">media</span>; I think about it in terms of <span class="inspectable">image</span>s, <span class="inspectable">audio</span>, and/or <span class="inspectable">video</span>.</p>
  <div class="likert" data-key="textualThinking" id="textualThinking" data-likert="Never,Rarely,Sometimes,Very Often,Always"></div>

<div class="other field">
  <p>Is there a similar generalization that we should have included? If so, please describe it in terms of its general structure (as opposed to its real-world meaning), in terms of how you think about it (not necessarily how it is stored on disk).</p>
